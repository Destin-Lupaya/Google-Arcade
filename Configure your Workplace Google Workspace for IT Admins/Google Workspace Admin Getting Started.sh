# Overview
# Google Workspace by Google Cloud is your go-to solution for productivity tools. Get more done with seamless collaboration tools, a simple management interface, and enterprise-level security and reliability. Easily add users, manage devices and configure security and settings so your data stays safe.

# Centralized administration makes set up and management fast and easy. But access to Google Workspace Administration controls is not commonly available for practice, so in this lab you are provided with an organization "Google Workspace Labs" and a temporary Google Workspace domain to work in. In this lab, you personalize your Google Workspace Admin console to suit your needs, and then make some basic modifications to the Admin Console, and modify the company profile. After, you provision users both individually and in a batch upload using a CSV file.

# Objectives
# In this lab, you customize your Workspace using the Google Workspace Admin Console:

# Change your organization's name

# Enter the correct primary and secondary administrator emails

# Select a default time zone for new users

# Select new user feature release schedule

# Select communication preferences for your domain

# Add your company's logo

# Add users individually and bulk uploading with a CSV file

# Log in as an added user to verify the customization

# Prerequisites
# To get the most from this lab, familiarity with basic Google Workspace terminology is recommended.

# Setup and requirements
# Before you click the Start Lab button
# Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

# This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

# To complete this lab, you need:

# Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
# Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
# Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
# Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
# Start your lab
# When you are ready, click Start Lab in the upper left.

# Sign in to the Google Workspace Admin Console
# To access the Google Workspace Admin Console, you must find your credentials and then sign in.

# Find your lab's User Email and Password
# To access the resources and console for this lab, locate the User Email and Password in the Lab Details panel. This panel is on the left or at the top, depending on the width of the browser window. Use these credentials to log in to the Google Workspace Admin Console.

# If your lab requires other resource identifiers or connection-related information, they will appear on this panel as well.

# Sign in to the Admin Console
# Click Open Google Workspace Admin Console.
# Tip: Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

# Password - must meet format guidelines, the default requirement is 8 characters. For example, "12345678".

# Org Unit Path - for this lab use a backslash (/).

# (Optional) Fill in the other columns.
# Note: To add multiple phone numbers or addresses for a user, add columns to the spreadsheet. Rename the header accordingly. For example, to add a second home address, create a new column with the header Home Address 2.
# Save the updated file as a CSV file on your computer.

# Select the CSV file to upload:

# Click Attach CSV file.

# Select the CSV file and click Open.
