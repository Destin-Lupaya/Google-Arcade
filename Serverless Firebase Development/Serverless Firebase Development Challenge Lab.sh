# Serverless Firebase Development: Challenge Lab
# 1 hour
# 5 Credits
# GSP344
# Google Cloud self-paced labs logo

# Overview
# In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

# When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

# To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

# This lab is recommended for students who are enrolled in the Serverless Firebase Development quest. Are you ready for the challenge?

# Setup and requirements
# Before you click the Start Lab button
# Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

# This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

# To complete this lab, you need:

# Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
# Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
# Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
# Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
# Provision the environment
# Link to the project:
#   gcloud config set project $(gcloud projects list --format='value(PROJECT_ID)' --filter='qwiklabs-gcp')
# Copied!
# Clone the repo:
#   git clone https://github.com/rosera/pet-theory.git
# Copied!
# Challenge scenario
# In this lab you will create a frontend solution using a Rest API and Firestore database. Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that is part of the Firebase platform where you can store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps at scale. Lab content is based on resolving a real world scenario through the use of Google Cloud serverless infrastructure.

# You will build the following architecture:

# To complete this section successfully, you are required to implement the following tasks:

# Use the sample code from pet-theory/lab06/firebase-import-csv/solution:
#   npm install
# Copied!
# To import CSV use the node pet-theory/lab06/firebase-import-csv/solution/index.js:
#   node index.js netflix_titles_original.csv
# Copied!
# Note: Verify the Firestore Database has been updated by viewing the data in the Firestore UI.
# Click Check my progress to verify that you've performed the above task.
# Populate the Firestore Database

# Task 3. Create a REST API
# In this scenario, create an example REST API.

# Cloud Run development
# Field	Value
# Container Registry Image	rest-api:0.1
# Cloud Run Service	Dataset Service Name
# Permission	--allow-unauthenticated
# To complete this section successfully, you are required to implement the following tasks:

# Access pet-theory/lab06/firebase-rest-api/solution-01.
# Build and Deploy the code to Google Container Registry.
# Deploy the image as a Cloud Run service.
# Note: Deploy your service with 1 max instance to ensure you do not exceed the max limit for Cloud Run instances.
# Go to Cloud Run and click Dataset Service Name then copy the service URL:
# SERVICE_URL=copy url from your Dataset Service Name
# curl -X GET $SERVICE_URL should respond with: {"status":"Netflix Dataset! Make a query."}
# Click Check my progress to verify that you've performed the above task.
# Deploy and test the REST API

# Task 4. Firestore API access
# In this scenario, deploy an updated revision of the code to access the Firestore DB.
